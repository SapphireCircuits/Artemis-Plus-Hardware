# Sapphire Circuits Artemis Plus Module

This is a remix of the Sparkfun Artemis module.  It is module pin-for-pin backward compatible with the original module except it has twice the Flash and RAM memory.

Modifications:
The original design has been modified to use the Ambiq Apollo3 Blue Plus instead of the Ambiq Apollo3 Blue Microcontroller.  Both micro-controllers have many pins, signals, and peripheral units in common.  However, the micro-controllers have physically different dimensions as, ball sizes, and the Artemis Plus version has additional pins.  Where possible, these pins were kept the same as to maintain as much compatibility as possible.  The trace and space as well as the individual routing for the signals needed to be adjusted due to differences in the locations and pin sizes. 

The original design files were designed in EAGLE, but for this remix it was imported into Altium Designer.
